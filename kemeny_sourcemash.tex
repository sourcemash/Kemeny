\subsection*{Acknowledgments}
Devin Balkcom, Professor of Computer Science at Dartmouth College, provided key guidance in the direction of Sourcemash's development throughout the duration of CS 98: Senior Design and Implementation Project. Michael Evans and Sravana Reddy, Neukom Fellows from the Neukom Institute at Dartmouth College, engaged in useful discussion with the authors and provided plentiful advice and feedback, without which Sourcemash could not have achieved such success.
